 AUS_Franz_den_Kaiser:0 "Gott erhalte Franz den Kaiser"
 AUS_Franz_den_Kaiser_desc:0 "Franz Josef has ruled the Austrian Empire since 1848 when he succeeded his uncle Ferdinand to the Austrian throne. Since then he is ruling through Vienna and is seen as the symbol of the might and unity of the Empire."
 AUS_kaiser_franz:0 "Kaiser Franz Josef"
 AUS_Italian_Question:0 "The Italian Question"
 AUS_Italian_Question_desc:0 "Ever since Napoleon invaded Italy there has been a major movement to unite the disparate states of Italy, which would threaten our control over Lombardy-Venetia. The hotbed of this movement is the Kingdom of Sardinia-Piedmont which already in 1849 tried to take over Lombardy but failed miserably. It is however very likely that another conflict should break out, and we must prepare for it."
 AUS_Reinforce_Lombardy:0 "Reinforce Lombardy"
 AUS_Reinforce_Lombardy_desc:0 "Lombardy has been since the Middle Ages one of the most important prosperous regions of Italy and has also been a very rebellious one as was painfully experienced by the Emperor Frederick Barbarossa at Legano in 1176. It is thus imperative that we send money and personel to reinforce Lombardy and Milan to prevent the Italians from having any 'revolutionary' ideas."
 AUS_Viceroy_Maximilian:0 "Appoint Maximilian as Viceroy"
 AUS_Viceroy_Maximilian_desc:0 "Archduke Maximilian is the Emperor's brother and a very competent naval leader making him an excellent candidate to replace Marshall Radetzky, who albeit having served the Empire faithfully has grown very old, as Viceroy of the Kingdom of Lombardy-Venice. There is however some opposition due to the Archduke's alleged 'liberal' ideas and that this might encourage the Italians."
 AUS_Klerikalabsolutist:0 "Klerikalabsolutist"
 AUS_Klerikalabsolutist_desc:0 "Baron Alexander von Bach has instituted a formidable system known as 'Klerikalabsolutism' where the Emperor and the Church have the leading role in administrating the state and ensuring the welfare of the subjects. There is however the ever persistent opposition of the liberals who attack von Bach's system as a very oppressive one and no better than Metternich's administration."
 AUS_Klerikalabsolutist1:0 "Klerikalabsolutist"
 AUS_Censor_Liberals:0 "Censor the Liberals"
 AUS_Censor_Liberals_desc:0 "The Liberals have grown to be quite a nuisance to the activities of Baron von Bach and their spreading of constitutional ideas would only endanger His Majesty's rule and the unity of the Empire."
 AUS_Abolish_Internal_Customs:0 "Abolish Internal Custom Duties"
 AUS_Abolish_Internal_Customs_desc:0 "It was decided in 1855 that all internal customs should be abolished between the Austrian Empire and the Lands of the Crown of Saint Stephen in order to facilitate trade and cooperation. Now the time has come to put this into effect."
 AUS_Abolish_Serfdom:0 "Abolish Serfdom"
 AUS_Abolish_Serfdom_desc:0 "The long awaited decision to abolish serfdom once for all from the Empire will be finally enacted bringing freedom upon millions of subjects who will naturally thank the Emperor for it."
 AUS_Subdue_Czechs:0 "Subdue the Czechs"
 AUS_Subdue_Czechs_desc:0 "The inhabitants of Bohemia-Moravia, known as the 'Czechs' have allied themselves with the German liberals and are a constant thorn in our side and aim to prevent the policies of Baron von Bach and his colleagues."
 AUS_Crack_Down_Hungarians:0 "Crack down on the Magyars"
 AUS_Crack_Down_Hungarians_desc:0 "The Magyars have remained extremelly disobedient since their crushing defeat in the revolution of 1848 and have systematically refused to participate in civil governance and to pay taxes. They are surely very bad subjects of His Majesty and it is very urgent that any revolutionary ideas that they carry should be stopped."
 AUS_Disaster_Italy:0 "Disaster in Italy"
 AUS_Disaster_Italy_desc:0 "The unexpected has happened! His Majesty's armies have been defeated in Lombardy, and it seems that even His Majesty intervened the tide could not be turned. The Italians could not have done this were it not for the French. Now that the defeat army is returning home many are already talking about a financial crisis and a political crisis and as in 1848 it is important to act quickly to avoid a disaster."
 AUS_lost_italy:0 "Disaster in Italy"
 AUS_lost_italy1:0 "Disaster in Italy"
 AUS_Victory_Italy:0 "Triumph in Italy"
 AUS_Victory_Italy_desc:0 "As expected our armies commanded by His Majesty have defeated the Italians and their allies and brough glory to the Empire. Piedmont has been defeated again, and this time it seems permanently. All nationalities of the Empire can agree that this victory proves the fortitude of the Empire."
 AUS_win_italy:0 "Triumph in Italy"
 AUS_Future_Italy:0 "The Future of Habsburg Italy"
 AUS_Future_Italy_desc:0 "With Italy firmly under our control it is wise that we make some rearrangements to the territorial divisions agreed in the Congress of Vienna in 1815 in order to curtail any future revolutionary activity and safeguard the independence of all the Italian states."
 AUS_tt_italian_lands_decisions:0 "Unlocks §Ydecisions to reform our Italy holdings§!"
 AUS_Fall_von_Bach:0 "Fall of von Bach"
 AUS_Fall_von_Bach_desc:0 "With the humiliating defeat against the Italians Baron von Bach must resign and allow more competent administrators to take his place in order to maintain order. "
 AUS_Need_Reform:0 "Need for Reforms"
 AUS_Need_Reform_desc:0 "The time of absolutism seems to have come to a close. Europe has grown much more liberal than in Metternich's time. His Majesty deems it necessary that the government is to start taking into account the will of the people in the political process, though that is to be naturally very liberal."
 AUS_Reichsrat_Advice:0 "Ask the Reichsrat for Advice"
 AUS_Reichsrat_Advice_desc:0 "The first step to making the Empire more constitutional is to ask the advice of the Reichsrat which until presently has served as an advisory body to His Majesty with no real political power. Should the reforms pass we could see a Reichsrat acting as a legislative body as is the case with the other German states."
 AUS_October_Diploma:0 "The October Diploma"
 AUS_October_Diploma_desc:0 "Count Gołuchowski, the recently appointed Interior Minister, has proposed that we pass a constitution, one that would satisfy both the population with a faint idea of constitutionalism and the aristocrats who wish to preserve the decentralisation."

 AUSdiplo.1.d:0 "The Kingdom of Lombardy-Venetia has been ours since the Congress of Vienna in 1815, following Napoleon's defeat. The Kingdom has however been a site of often violent insurrections by Italian nationalists again the Habsburg rule and with our close victory against Piedmont the time has come to decide on how we should deal with the Kingdom. A prominent idea put forward by the Conservatives is to annex Venice into the Austrian Empire, effectively recreating the Duchy of Lombardy. A popular option amongst the more Moderates is to keep the same structure for the Kingdom while the Liberals propose to give it more autonomy, in order to satisfy the Italians."

The Duchy of Modena and the Grand Duchy of Tuscany have been ruled by the Habsburgs while the Duchy of Parma has been ruled by a Bourbon, which has effectively made these three states our client states due to our ideological and military support to them. With the war now over, we can finally see what we should do with the three states. Conservatives propose we keep the status quo, which would make them susceptible to nationalist infiltrations. Liberals on the other hand propose that we create a loose confederation named the "Italian League" to convince the Italians that the Habsburgs have only good plans for Italy."

For centuries both Italian, they were in 1792 annexed in the French Republic due to their high French population before being returned to Piedmont in the Congress of Vienna in 1815. Now that Piedmont is firmly under our rule, we can opt to cede them to France. Doing so will increase our relations with Napoleonic France, which might entice them to help us in our struggle with Prussa, but it will alienate Britain, and will anger Italian nationalists even further."
 AUSdiplo.3.a:0 "We need all the friends we can get"
 AUSdiplo.3.b:0 "It is too risky"
 AUSdiplo.4.t:0 "Austria cedes Savoy and Nice"
 AUSdiplo.4.d:0 "On [GetDateText] our troops entered Savoie and Nice for the first time since 1815, when it was ceded to the Piedmontese. The population cheered the French troops and thousands attended the official ceremony of the handing of Chambery from Austria to France. The agreement known as the 'Franco-Austrian Agreement on Savoy of [GetYear]' was signed between Interior Minister [AUS.GetLeader] of Austria and [FRA.GetLeader] of France. With this glorious agreement the Austrians showed that not only they can be trusted, but in fact they can be good friends of ours. The Emperor later declared that 'the old grudge between France and the Habsburgs has been ended, now we can only expect friendship', effectively instructing the politicians to consider Austria a friend, not an enemy."

For centuries both Italian, they were in 1792 annexed in the French Republic due to their high French population before being returned to Piedmont in the Congress of Vienna in 1815. With Austria defeating Piedmont and then imposing a puppet state over it, they decided to cede Savoy and Nice to Napoleonic France. While this is a minor event on its own, it might suggest a rapprochement between Austria and Franch who after all share the same ideological values and are both hostile against Prussia. Should such an alliance be formed, it would be very dangerous for the stability of Europe."

It is wise that he is to be recalled back to Wien, and instead let the Emperor take direct control of the situation to avoid demoralizing entirely the Austrian army. Should Ferenc Gyulay remain as Feldmarschall, this will surely anger the people and the army."

 AUShungaryrevolt.1.t:0 "The Winds of Change in Hungary"
 AUShungaryrevolt.1.d:0 "A very important report has arrived from the Minister of Interior [AUS.GetLeader] describing a resurgence of Magyar nationalism due to our aggressive policies and actions in the past years. The Secret Police has tracked down several 'Pro-Independence Commitees' operating throughout Hungary and many more are believed to exist. These commitees have been collecting funds from abroad to fund a planned revolt. In addition to that, the people too appear dissatisfied with our administration and a large part of the Magyars have refused to pay taxes. The general consensus is that an uprising appears to be planned in Hungary."

 AUShungaryrevolt.2.d:0 "Disaster has struck the monarchy. The Minister of Interior was indeed correct to assume the existence of a large network conspiring to establish an independent Hungary. Several thousand of men throughout the Lands of the Crown of Saint Stephen have taken up arms and have declared the 'Hungarian Republic' under the leadership of Lajos Kossuth who is currently on exile in Turin, in the [PIE.GetName]. The Hungarian revolt has been dubbed 'the Second Hungarian Revolution' and should we not crush the revolt as quickly as possible, it is very much possible that the Lands of the Crown of Saint Stephen will be lost from the Habsburg domains, and that the Magyars will inspire other nationalities within our empire such as Slavs or Romanians to revolt as well."
